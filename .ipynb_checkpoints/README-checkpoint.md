Some python code to analyze chicago crime statistics by looking at police records 

The city of Chicago provides reported incidents of crime since 2001 (except murder) (here)[https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2]. I use 2022 and 2023's data for this analysis.

Another useful link is [this](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Boundaries-Police-Beats-current-/aerh-rz74), which gives a map of police districts and beats.
